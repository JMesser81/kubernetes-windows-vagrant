# Kubernetes On-Premises Deployment From Scratch -- Start to Finish #
This guide will walk you through deploying *Kubernetes 1.8* on a Linux master and join two Windows nodes to it without a cloud provider.

**Note**: The guide will assume a local working directory of `~/kube` for the Kubernetes setup. If you choose a different directory, just replace any references to that path.

## Building the Binaries ##
We will begin with a Linux master node and a Windows worker node on RS3+, both of which are assumed to be VMs.

First, install all of the pre-requisites on the master:

    # apt-get install git build-essentials docker.io

### Building Kubernetes ###
We will need to build the `kubelet` and `kubeproxy` binaries for Windows from scratch _cross-compiling from Linux_, so let's [set up a Go environment](https://golang.org/doc/install#install) for that, first. This guide assumes Go 1.9 and has not been tested with anything else. With your Go environment ready (don't forget to set your `$GOPATH`!), we can build the Windows binaries:

```bash
$ K8SREPO="github.com/madhanrm/kubernetes"
$ go get -d $K8SREPO
$ cd $GOPATH/src/$K8SREPO
$ git checkout cniwindows
$ make clean && KUBE_BUILD_PLATFORM=windows/amd64 make WHAT=cmd/kubelet
$ cp ~/_output/bin/kubelet.exe ~/kube/
$ git checkout winkernelproxy 
$ KUBE_BUILD_PLATFORM=windows/amd64 make WHAT=cmd/kube-proxy
$ cp ~/_output/bin/kube-proxy.exe ~/kube/
```

_You may run into problems with various "permission denied" errors when building these binaries. This is a bug in the Kubernetes build process for Windows, which uses binaries that exist, but are size-zero, and thus don't have executable permissions on them. The solution, unfortunately, is to run `chmod +x _output/bin/*` after every time (~4 times) you hit the error._

Done! Now, we also need the actual Linux Kubernetes binaries for v1.8. You can pull these from [the Kubernetes mainline](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.8.0-rc.1), or build them from source as above, except using `K8SREPO=k8s.io/kubernetes` and the `release-1.8` branch. Copy these to `~/kube/bin` (note the extra `/bin` compared to the above path; we actual need to use these during master configuration, rather than just copying them to the Windows node).

### Install CNI ###
We also need to install the basic CNI binaries so that networking works. Download them from [here](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/releases) and copy them to `/opt/cni/bin/`.

## Prepare the Master ##
Copy the entire directory from [this repository](), which contains a lot of the setup scripts and Kubernetes files that are essential to this process. Check them all out to `~/kube/` and make the scripts executable. This entire directory will be getting mounted for a lot of the docker containers in future steps, so keep its structure the same as outlined in the guide. 

We'll be creating the service cluster on the virtual subnet 11.0/16. This isn't configurable, so if you want to tweak this, it'll require manual modification.

### Certificates ###
First, prepare the certificates that will be used for nodes to communicate inthe cluster. Run `generate-certs.sh` (in the `certs/` directory), passing**your** external IP as its (only) parameter:

    ~/kube/certs $ ./generate-certs.sh 10.0.0.5

### Allow Routing ###
_This step may be optional, depending on whether or not you've configured your intended cluster subnet to be routable already_.

Windows nodes will each grab a /24 from the cluster, so if your cluster CIDR is 192.168.0.0/16, a Windows node will use 192.168.0.1/24. Just run:

    ~/kube $ generate-routes.sh 192.168

### Configure & Run Kubernetes ###
Run the script `configure-kubectl.sh`, passing your external IP again, to create a configuration in `~/.kube/config` containing all of the certificate data and other parameters:

    ~/kube $ ./configure-kubectl.sh 10.0.0.5

Run the script `start-kubelet.sh`. You may need to run it with `sudo`. Then, copy the Kubernetes configuration file to the local kubelet mount path:

    $ sudo cp ~/.kube/config kubelet/

**TODO**: Why is this necessary? Shouldn't this be done automatically by one of the containers?

In another terminal session, run the Kubeproxy script, passing your cluster CIDR (you may also need to run this one with `sudo`):

    ~/kube $ ./kubeproxy.sh 192.168

After some time, you should see the following system state:

  - Under `docker ps`, you should see worker and pod containers mirroring the configs in `manifest/` and in `addons/`.
  - A call to `~/kube/bin/kubectl cluster-info` should show info for the Kubernetes master, DNS, and heapster.
  - A new interface `cbr0` under `ipconfig`, with your chosen cluster CIDR.

## Join a Windows Node ##
Like for Linux, we need an assortment of scripts to prepare things for us. They can be found [here](). Place these in a new folder, `C:\k\`. We also need to copy the .exe binaries we compiled earlier (which we placed in `~/kube/`), as well as the Kubectl config file (from `~/.kube/config`), into this folder.

### Build Docker Image ###
We need to build the docker image for the Kubernetes infrastructure. Navigate
to `C:\k\` and run:

    C:\k> docker pull microsoft/windowsservercore-insider:latest
    C:\k> docker tag [SHA from previous cmd] microsoft/windowsservercore:latest
    C:\k> docker build -t kublet/pause .

### Join to Cluster ###
Now, if your cluster CIDR isn't routable, just run this in PowerShell:

    C:\k> AddRoutes.ps1 -MasterIp [Linux Master]

Then, in two PowerShell windows, simply run `./start-kubelet.ps1` and `./start-kubeproxy.ps1` (in that order). You should be able to see the Windows node when running `./bin/kubectl get nodes` on the Linux master, shortly!
